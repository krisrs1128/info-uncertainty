title: "Erosion Process Visualization"
---

Once upon a time, I made a [processing
sketch](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/48684) of an erosion process,
inspired by lectures in a probability course I was taking.

This example is still one I revisit whenever I'm trying to learn new
visualization tools. I recently made another version using
[Observables](https://beta.observablehq.com), you can find it
[here](https://beta.observablehq.com/@krisrs1128/untitled).
Try fiddling with parameters in the code blocks -- you can see the
visualizations update in real time.
