I prepared these <a href="{{ site.url }}/images/vae_notes.pdf"> slides </a> for
a reading group lecture on variational autoencoders and sequence-to-sequence
modeling. My aim was to provide some visual intuition without sacrificing
mathematical precision. I hope you enjoy the notes, feel free to use the images
in any of your work.
