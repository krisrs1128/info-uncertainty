<p>Once upon a time, I made a <a href="https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/48684">processing
sketch</a> of an erosion process,
inspired by lectures in a probability course I was taking.</p>

<p>This example is still one I revisit whenever I’m trying to learn new
visualization tools. I recently made another version using
<a href="https://beta.observablehq.com">Observables</a>, you can find it
<a href="https://beta.observablehq.com/@krisrs1128/untitled">here</a>.
Try fiddling with parameters in the code blocks – you can see the
visualizations update in real time.</p>
