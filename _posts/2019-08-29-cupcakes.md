By this point, it's a bit cliche to say that data is
"[the](https://fortune.com/2016/07/11/data-oil-brainstorm-tech/)
[new](https://hackernoon.com/data-is-the-new-oil-1227197762b2/)
[oil](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data/)[.](https://medium.com/@amitgarg/data-is-the-new-oil-ai-is-the-new-electricity-who-is-building-the-new-railroads-c8995faa8fd2)"
It's the sort of phrase you might have heard if you didn't have headphones on
when you went to that one [hip cafe](https://tinyurl.com/y53g79n6) the other
day. And while some parts of the metaphor are relevant ("[Data
spill](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandale_Facebook-Cambridge_Analytica)" has
kind of a ring to it), other parts are potentially misleading, especially for an
aspiring data scientist.

Instead, I propose that we think of data as cupcakes, or really, desserts more
generally. There are some reasons,

1. Data are the result of human intervention. Data don't just exist in the
   ground because dinosaurs died a long time ago (though, sticklers might
   [disagree](http://dinosaurpictures.org/)). Someone has to deliberately place
   a sensor somewhere, or track a user's browsing behavior, or run a sample
   through some device, or launch a camera into space.... and then write down
   everything that the sensor saw, because they think that information might be
   useful for some reason someday.

   Of course, this is just like cupcakes. Cupcakes don't appear out of thin air
   (we can dream), they are deliberately constructed for human consumption.
2. Data are wildly varied across domains. This is a corollary of point 1. Since
   data are generated by people, and since people have extraordinarily diverse
   backgrounds and intentions, the data you will encounter as a professional
   data scientist will vary dramatically from project to project. Museum
   directors, city planners, ecologists, and healthcare providers are all
   collecting data these days -- I think it's a small miracle that a few of our
   mathematical abstractions (randomness, latent structure, inference) are
   relevant across such broad domains.

   Oil is oil no matter where you go, desserts come in
   [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Turkish_desserts)
   [different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Argentine_sweets_and_desserts)
   [flavors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_desserts).
3. We can strengthen point 2, if we note that, even within a single application
   domain, the data are not uniform. It's now standard for a genomics data
   analysis to incorporate measurements from many different modalities. Formal
   government surveys are often complemented by automatically recorded
   transactions. On the internet, images, text, temporal, and relational
   information are all baked together into a delicious, fruit-filled, and
   icing-topped whole, as you will discover in your course project.
   
Okay, okay, I know what you're going to say, "But Kris, cupcakes have never
jeopardized civil society" and "all these additional dessert regulations are
going to stifle [innovation](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake_Boss)." Yes,
this metaphor has it's own limits, but I hope I've gotten my main point across,
which is that data are human artifacts, generated by people with diverse visions
of the future.
