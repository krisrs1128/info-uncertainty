title: "Nepal AI Winter School Lecture Notes"
---

Last month, I prepared a series of lectures for the (really wonderfully
organized) first [Nepal AI Winter School](https://nepalschool.naamii.com.np/).

The main talks were,

* [Deep Learning Foundations](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cpYlXURNsoWnmCfKAG3HGvZh9SeIG2Ps)
* [Humanitarian AI](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d60GI41oSrldtMKcCOwaVom1TRm0Z8sF)
* [Useful Layers](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13YDzxi8BerO20VzSC2__TEchgwnr-r8L)
* [Bayesian Deep Learning](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17Rd96ADwoSUFi5M_VT0L8326gnLl-vka)
* [GANs](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OHNLoAr_om59VSkwMEFQky6aeagx0eQR)
* [Metalearning](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b9jVlG2vS2-WU9p6R7-QuRv5uEqHy3Yn)
* [Interpretability](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12aDxwkUYSU5vt3dcg7N3j3NsTahLe6hC)

The lecture videos are online <a

I also prepared a short [exercise
sheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16iQEE_5gD0HYG3CRJWpK-BzxdmSrouUr)
([solutions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1g1q5J6BIKCcMemvMok98mjlJ_Bq5ZV3a)).

In retrospect, I would have given a more visual introduction to VAEs. As a
placeholder until I write about this in depth, here are some

I kept from a discussion with students from a lab session during the school. I
think the most useful pair of pictures was the per-pixel gaussians from the
encoder (first page bottom left) and latent-space axis-aligned gaussians (second
page top right)
