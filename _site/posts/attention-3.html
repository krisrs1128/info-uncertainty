          <p>To this point, our memory mechanisms all have had the same flavor. We had a
running summary \(h_t\), which we update with every new input, though gating
might mean we prevent some coordinates from changing too much. However, it’s
possible to think more creatively about how we should record and attend to new
memories. For example,</p>

<ol>
  <li>We don’t need to throw away all but the last \(h_t\) when making some
prediction. We’ve been saying that a model “forgets” if there are values for
\(h_t\) early on which are erased by new inputs. But what if we just kept all
the \(h_t\)’s, and avoided overload by having a smart lookup strategy?</li>
  <li>Why are we forcing the memory \(h_t\) to architecturally mirror the inputs
\(x_t\) – that is, why does \(h_t\) need to be a sequence? Considering that,
due to gating, we only update some cells at a time, it makes sense to design
architectures specifically adapted to recording and looking up useful
summaries.</li>
  <li>We’ve assumed a pretty diligent sequential processor, which knows to check
every input datapoint as it arrives. What if we had a lazy one, which played
it fast and loose and tried to process only those inputs that seemed really
crucial to the process.</li>
</ol>

<p>These sorts of preposterous questions will help illuminate the more fundamental
principles of memory and attention in deep learning<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>First though, a warning, reiterating points from part 1. Attention is not a
well-defined, clearly demarcated mathematical term. It is a principle that is
useful for reasoning about many problems, but which is always in flux, as people
find variants that are suited to their particular settings.</p>

<p>To keep our discussion grounded, and to leave you with something mathematical
examples (and not just cool paper titles) that you can take home, we’re going to
explore a few attention mechanisms in detail, before briefly touring across
other highlights of the memory and attention literature.</p>

<p>Our three methods mirror the three questions from before.</p>

<h2 id="attention-in-translation-models">Attention in Translation Models</h2>

<p>We don’t need to force \(h_t\) to condense everything from \(x_1, \dots, x_t\).
This observation lies at the heart of attention-based encoder-decoder sequence
translation models. Before explaining the mechanism in more detail, a refresher
on how translation works with neural networks.</p>

<p>Abstractly, the problem of translation is to map a sequence of words in one
language to the corresponding sequence in another. For example,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t speak French –&gt; Je ne parle pas le Francais.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We make this an ML problem by treating each word as a datapoint in a sequence,
and hoping to map the first trajectory into the second. That is, we want to map</p>

\[\begin{align}
\left(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\right) \to \left(y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5, y_6\right)
\end{align}\]

<p>where \(x_i = \left(0, \dots, 0, 1, 0, \dots, 0\right)\) is a one-hot encoding
of the \(i^{th}\) word in the sentence (with respect to the \(V\) words in
English that we bother taking into account), and \(y_i\) does the same for
French.</p>

<p>The encoder-decoder approach to the problem is to take the \(x_t\) and summarize
(“encode”) them using an RNN<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. The final state $h_{T}$ is then used as the
used as the initial state to a separate RNN, whose states are used to predict
the words of the translation. Here’s a basic picture. The shading means that teh
same values are copied over.</p>

<p>At the \(t^{th}\) time step during decoding, we use a processor \(s_t =
f_{\text{dec}}\left(\hat{y}_{t - 1}, h_{t - 1}\right)\), and then predict
\(p\left(y_t \vert s_t, s_{0}, \hat{y}_{t - 1}\right)\) using logistic
regression. A good processor should be able to capture the salient features of
\(x_1, \dots, x_{T}\), and these are used for translation.</p>

<p>This seems like a large burden for the encoder to carry. Intuitively, at time
\(t\) of decoding, you really only care about the words in the corresponding
neigorhood of time \(t\) in the source sentence. If the sentences were already
aligned, you’d expect the neighborhood around \(h_t\) to be most relevant for
being able to translate \(y_t\).</p>

<p>So, consider the mechanism, \(s_{t^{\prime}} = \sum_{t = 1}^{T} w_{t t^{\prime}}
h_t\), which adds columns \(h_t\) weighted by \(w_t t^{prime}\)’s, which we call attention
weights. Of course, we need the \(w_{tt^{\prime}}\)’s to be learned directly
from data – this is the same problem as in gatings. The solution shouldn’t be a
surprise: we use a differentiable, parameterized function. For example, we could
use</p>

\[\begin{align}
w_{t t^{\prime}} \propto a_{W_{a}}\left(h_t, s_{t^{\prime}}\right) = h_t^{T} W_{a} s_{t^{\prime}}
\end{align}\]

<p>to measure the angle between particular coordinates of the encodings.</p>

<p>It’s worth highlighting what <em>doesn’t</em> directly appear in this definition – the
times \(t\) and \(t^{\prime}\) themselves. This version of attention is a purely
“content-based” form of attention, which cares only about the encodings \(h_t\)
and \(s_t^{\prime}\). There are variants that take the times themselves into
account, so that the decoding at time \(t^{\prime}\) explicitly upweights
encodings at around that time in the original sequence<sup id="fnref:2:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>There are a lot of moving parts here – an encoder, a decoder, and an attention
module to link them together. But everything is end-to-end differentiable, and
you can take the gradients of mistranslations with respect to all parameters.</p>

<p>Stepping back, this is a way of reweighting – or attending to – specific
encodings as a function of our current position in the decoding task at hand. We
have provided some much needed relief for our lone encoder by more richly
relating elements of our differentiable system. We no longer need a processor
that compresses everything into one statistic \(h_{T}\) because we have a more
sophisticated way of navigating a large collection of summaries and pulling out
what is useful.</p>

<p>This kind of search for locally relevant information is a hallmark of attention
mechanisms. More specifically, this pattern of breaking a task into pieces
\(t^{\prime}\) and finding a way to learn different distributions \(w_{\cdot
t^{\prime}}\) over relevant summaries is one that appears througout the
literature on soft-attention mechanisms.</p>

<h2 id="neural-turing-machines">Neural Turing Machines</h2>

<p>This discussion suggests that more carefully structured (if potentially
intricate) mechanisms for looking thigns up can alleviate problems of
remembering information that was introduced long ago. This is actually a general
principle, not just some quirk about encoder-decoder architectures. To
illustrate this, we consider the Neural Turing Machine.</p>

<p>Again, there is a bit going on. The diagram below introduces the cast of
characters.</p>

<p>Given new input, we produce a weight distribution for what seem like the most
relevant memory locations. Notice that if the rows correspond to times \(1,
\dots, T\), then the matrix \(M\) is a lot like a stacked version of the \(h_1,
\dots, h_T\) from the RNN models before. And, the \(w_{t}\)’s do seem eerily
like the attention weights from before. That said, we’re trying to free
ourselves from the idea that memories must be indexed by time.</p>

<p>In this spirit of generalization, we can define soft-attention
variant,</p>

\[\begin{align}
r_t &amp;= \sum_{i} w_{ti} M\left[i, :\right].
\end{align}\]

<p>Something in this architecture which <em>is</em> new, and not just a variant of what we
saw before in translation, is a notion of writing to memory. We use weights,
along with the add and erase vectors, to define a memory update,</p>

<p>\(\begin{align}
M\left[i: \right] \xleftarrow M\left[i, :\right] + w_{ti}\left(a_t - e_t \circ M\left[i, :\right]\right).
\end{align}\)
If the weight is small, we don’t change that location in memory at all. If it is
large, we add in \(a_t\) and erase everything that had been at that row, with an
aggressiveness controlled by \(e_t\) (coordinates where that vector is near
\(1\) are almost entirely reset).</p>

<p>The only remaining issue is how to figure out a good combination of parameters
\(w_t, a_t\), and \(e_t\), upon seeing a new input \(x_t\).</p>
