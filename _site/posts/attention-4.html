          <p>There is more to memory than compression. A reduction of information can have
<em>structure</em> – for example, in a gaussian mixture model, the sufficient
statistics have are the means within each cluster. Depending on which cluster
you might be visiting, you might focus on a different one of the means. A good
compression should induce an effortless way of searching through different parts
of a summary. In essence,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good models let us navigate information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In deep learning, this process of navigating information is called “attending
to” different inputs. We’ll illustrate a canonical attention mechanism in the
context of sentence translation, but it’s worth noting that the principle
applies to many settings with structured outputs (like graphs), where the
influences from input to output are somehow localized.</p>

<p>In the abstract, sentence translation is a prediction problem where the inputs
are sequences and the outputs are also sequences. The input and output are the
same sentence in a source and a target language, respectively. Each element of
the sequence is a word in the sentence. Words can be represented either by
one-hot encodings from some vocabulary (usually, the words in a corpus above
some minimum frequency), or by embeddings derived from some previously trained
model on another corpus. This is illustrated in the figure below.</p>

</figure>

<p>Once you make the leap into representing words as numerical vectors, it’s
natural to think of sentences as curves in some high-dimensional space. The two
sentences are just two curves in two spaces, and you need to learn to predict
the second from the first. The reason this problem is doable is because, after
seeing enough training examples, you might associated certain subsequences (mini
curve shapes) in the source space with subsequences in the target space.</p>

<h3 id="sequence-to-sequence-architecture">Sequence-to-Sequence Architecture</h3>

<p>I’m tempted to call the first approach to this problem the “naive approach,”
except that it doesn’t feel right to call something naive that was
state-of-the-art only a couple of years ago [1].</p>

<p>The idea is to build a link between the two sequence shapes, using an
appropriate learned representation. You can think of it as a two step process,</p>

<p>(1) Build a memory of the first sequence, which you’ll be able to refer to later
on.
(2) Learn to associate the memory of the first sequence with a reasonable shape
for the second.</p>

<p>Step (1) is done with an RNN encoder, just like what we’ve been exploring in the
previous posts. The final state \(h_{T}\) (the final green bar) gives a succint
representation of the entire sequence (the red dots). More than being an
unsupervised representation, it’s one that’s been tailored exactly for the
problem of decoding into the target language.</p>

<p>The second step is also accomplished by an RNN, but with a a couple twists. As
in usual RNNs, you build up a summary, let’s call it \(\tilde{h}_t\), based on the
previous timepoints summary, and also a new input, the previous target word
\(y_t\). The idea is that the summary is giving a sense of what the sequence means
so far, which is useful for figuring out how it will evolve (certain shapes are
much more common than others). The first twist is that you also are allowed to
look at the summary the source sequence, the original \(h_T\) (practically, this
is just another linear input to the RNN unit).</p>

<p>The second twist is that the inputs are not properly specified, because they
aren’t actually available at test time. If you knew \(y_t\), you wouldn’t need to
bother with prediction in the first place! Instead, you should build a separate
prediction model from \(\tilde{h}_t\) to \(\hat{y}\) and use the predictions for the
actual inputs (an alternative, called “teacher-forcing,” uses the real \(y_t\)
during training time, can have advantages, but comes with it’s own issues). This
process is illustrated below. The dashed line are the predictions that you have
access to, and the length of the yellow curves gives a sense of the loss.</p>

<h3 id="attention">Attention</h3>

<p>The decoding process above puts a lot of burden on the final encoded \(h_T\) from
the first sequence. This seems easily avoidable – it’s not like we need to
throw away all the previous summaries because of computational constraints.
Moreover, you would expect that the summaries \(h_t\) and \(\tilde{h}_t\) might be
closely related in timepoints that are close together. The beginning of the
source and target sentences should mean essentially the same thing, even though
they are in different languages.</p>

<p>Soft attention is the name of a type of learning module designed directly around
this observation [2]. The idea is to use a different summary at each step of
decoding. Instead of only ever using \(h_T\), we’re allowed to use some
combination \(\sum_{i} \alpha_i h_i\) of the encoder summaries, where the weights
\(\alpha_i\) depend on the timepoint of the decoder. These weights are illustrated
by the pink distributions in the figure below.</p>

<figure>
<img src="http://localhost:4000/images/soft_attn_figs/attn_distn_1.svg" />
</figure>

<p>At the next timepoint, the attetion distribution is free to change, according to
the new position of the decoder. This extra degree of flexibility – the fact
that the RNN decoder has access to different encoder summaries at different
timepoints, not just the unchanging \(h_T\) – is the property that distinguishes
a decoder with an attetion mechanism from a ordinary decoder. A updated attetion
distribution, associated with the next decoder timepoint, is show in the figure
below.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>Exercise: Write out pseudocode for the forwards pass of a sequece-to-sequece
model with an attetion mechanism in the decoder.</p>

<p>How does the model know what \(\alpha_i\) distributions are most appropriate for
the different sentences? After all, it must be learned from the data, somehow.
There is no single consensus on how to define these weights, and many papers
have been written specifically around novel proposals for guiding attention
effectively. That said, two approaches are representative of a wide class of
mechanisms [3],</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local attention: At step \(t\) in decoding, define \(\alpha_i \propto
\exp\left(w_1^{T} \tilde{h}_t, \dots, w_T^{T}\tilde{h}_t\right)\). Or, in pseudocode,
the \(\alpha\) vector can be computed as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a = softmax(l(h_t))</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l =
nn.linear(dim(h_t), T)</code>.</li>
  <li>Content-based attention: At step \(t\) in decoding, define \(\alpha_i \propto
\exp\left(h_1^{T}\tilde{h}_t, \dots, h_T^{T}\tilde{h}_t\right)\). In
pseudocode, this is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a = softmax(H_enc @ h_t)</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H_enc</code> is formed by
stacking the summaries \(h_1, \dots, h_T\) as rows.</li>
</ul>

<p>The main difference is that local attention does not refer to the encoder
summaries \(h_t\). It puts high mass on some parts of the source sentence
depending solely on the state of the decoder \(\tilde{h}_t\). The decoder
summaries tend to reflect, in some of their coordinates, how far along into the
target sentence they are. So, these attention distributions tend to just place
high mass on timepoints in the encoder close to the current timepoint in the
decoder.</p>

<p>The content-based attention mechanism, on the other hand, allots weight
\(\alpha_i\) according to how similar the source and target encodings are (a large
inner product corresponds to a small angle). This means that if there is are words
in the source sentence that have similar meaning \(h_t\) to the current decoder
summary, \(\tilde{h}_t\), then those words will be upweighted, no matter their
position in the sentence. This is qualitatively illustrated in the figure below.
The content-based approach places high mass near the end of the encoder
sentence, because it is close (in the embedding space), to the meaning at the
decoder timepoint. This is in spite of the fact that those words occur at a
timepoint very different than the current decoder timepoint.</p>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>

<p>No matter how we define the \(\alpha_i\)’s, the fact that we learn them has a nice
consequence: for free, we’ve learned a soft-alignment between the source and
target sentence. At any timepoint in decoding, the encodings with high
\(\alpha_i\) are said to “softly-align” to that timepoint. In this way, you might
notice “inversions,” where the decoder doesn’t just proceed linearly down the
encoder, placing all mass on \(h_t\) when decoding \(\tilde{h}_t\). This is common
in translation between languages that put adjectives before / after nouns, for
example.</p>

<p>A final observation – including this mechanism is especially beneficial when
working with long sentences. This is phenomenon documented in the literature
[2], and it makes sense in retrospect: long sentences are more suceptible to the
vanishing gradient problem, and even with gating, the final \(h_T\) tends to
mostly reflect cotributions from the end of the source sentence. A approach with
an attetion mechaism, in contrast, can always draw on summaries taken near the
start of the sentence, by putting most of the mass of the \(\alpha_i\) there.</p>

<p>Finally, while we’ve focused on attention in a sequence to sequence context,
it’s worth noting that these principles extend much more generally. Whenever you
have a structured output or collection of tasks, it’s possible to refer to
summaries selectively, attending to only those that are most relevant for the
current element in the more complex structure / collection. For example, in a
graph problem, only the nearby nodes might be worth attending to. The general
takeaway is that, whenever you might be able to exploit specific structure in
the relationship between summaries $h_t$, you can design an attention mechanism
that makes learning from them simpler.</p>
